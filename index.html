    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

    <p> Hello! My name is Rachel, and I’m a third-year student majoring in Computer Science and Philosophy. This semester, I’m taking two data science classes, a philosophy course, and an accounting class. I really enjoy having a diverse schedule because it allows me to explore both analytical and creative ways of thinking while connecting different subjects. Outside of class, I’ve been involved in a few clubs at Northeastern, including iGEM and Habitat for Humanity, which have helped me build teamwork skills and connect with others through meaningful projects.
      I’m originally from New Jersey, but I moved to Boston for school and have grown to love the city’s energy and walkability. Beyond academics, I have several artistic hobbies—I love painting with watercolor, creating decoupage art, reading, and baking desserts. I enjoy books from all kinds of genres, and I’m currently reading Mockingjay, the third book in The Hunger Games series. Traveling is also something I’m passionate about. I studied abroad in Greece, where I explored the Greek islands and even visited nearby countries. Two of my favorite places I’ve been to so far are Budapest and London.
       </p>
