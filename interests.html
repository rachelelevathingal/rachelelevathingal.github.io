    <h2>What I’m Exploring</h2> <!-- Note: smaller than Home page's H1 -->

    <p>Decoupaging is a creative art form that involves decorating objects by gluing pieces of paper onto them and sealing the surface with layers of varnish or glue, such as Mod Podge. The word comes from the French term découper, meaning “to cut out.” It’s a craft that allows people to transform everyday items into personalized works of art.
        To start, you choose images or patterns from magazines, wrapping paper, or napkins, then carefully cut them out. These designs are arranged on the object’s surface, creating a collage effect. Once glued down, you can add several layers of gloss which is brushed over the top to create a smooth finish. The layering gives the illusion that the artwork is painted directly onto the object.
        One of the best things about decoupaging is how relaxing and accessible it is. It doesn’t require expensive tools or special training—just creativity and patience. You are able to make every project as unique as you want as you can use many different materials and a variety of objects. Personally I used to do it mostly on shoeboxes because even if you mess up it is not a high risk type of object. My favorite project though was when I did it on a pan, which is now used as decor in my house!
